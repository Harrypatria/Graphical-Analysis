## Gestalt Principles
Gestalt Principles are an essential part of visual design. There are more than ten overlapping principles; four of the most widely recognized ones are:

- **Closure (Reification)**: We prefer complete shapes, so we automatically fill in 
gaps between elements to perceive a complete image. That’s how we can see the whole first. You can apply closure in all sorts of imaginative ways to win users’ admiration and trust when they recognize pleasing “wholes” in cleverly placed elements, be they lines, dots or shapes (e.g., segments of a picture). Iconic logos such as IBM’s and the World Wildlife Fund’s are examples of applied closure—IBM’s comprising blue horizontal lines arranged in three stacks; the WWF’s consisting of a cluster of black shapes set against a white background to reveal the familiar form of a panda. .

- **Common Region**: We group elements that are in the same closed region. You include related objects in the same closed area to show they stand apart from other groups. You can see this principle applied in Facebook, for example, where likes, comments and other interactions appear within the boundaries of one post and so stand apart from others.
